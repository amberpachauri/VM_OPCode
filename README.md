# VM_OPCode


This file was used to run execute bianry code on virtual machine to decode sequence bytes
send across from transcoders. These transcoders are effectively used for implementation 
into audio/ video libraries.

Hence the implementation contains 2-phase finite automata to conclude upon the instruction-set
as decoded from VMFiles to be used as part of execution process.

Enjoy!
