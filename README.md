# VM_OPCode


This is TurboC 3.0/ DOS program utility created with concept of Virtual-Machine. As it runs based on commands being passed
with each command instruction, in itself is encrypted dataset from transcoders.

The VMOPCode is like dynamic stack which keeps un/rolling with data being read from binary sources( files )   : *.bin fles.

This file was used to run execute bianry code on virtual machine to decode sequence bytes, send across from transcoders. 
These transcoders are effectively used for implementation into audio/ video libraries. Hence the code implementation contains 
2-phase finite automata to conclude upon the instruction-set as decoded from VMFiles to be used as part of execution process.



Enjoy!
