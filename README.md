# VM_OPCode


This is TurboC 3.0/ DOS program utility created with concept of Virtual-Machine, and it runs based on commands being passed
with each command instruction is in itself encrypted data for which gets decoded and stored and read back again.

The VM is like dynamic stack which keeps un/rolling with the kind of data being read from sources of kind : *.bin fles.

This file was used to run execute bianry code on virtual machine to decode sequence bytes, send across from transcoders. 
These transcoders are effectively used for implementation into audio/ video libraries. Hence the code implementation contains 
2-phase finite automata to conclude upon the instruction-set as decoded from VMFiles to be used as part of execution process.



Enjoy!
